# Business-English-Course
An offline course talked about using professional English while making reports, or sending emails, in order to enhance communication and speaking in front of people, either face to face or behind screens in case of working remotely.
In course capstone, we were asked about making a presentation about any topic related to business, in order to practice talking in front of others, and to apply skills presentation like standing confidently, applying propriate body language and making eye contacts with audience, and how to engaged them with the presentation.
I tried to apply material of presentation conditions, like making interconnected slides, and not to put so much text, and finally make a Q and A part.
